# Registration_data_collector
This is a simple python project which is a registration page . The registration page has labels which ask user some basic required data . When user fills his / her data , it will be saved in an excel file . 
To do this project I have used Tkinter module and Openpyxl module . Tkinter prvides me GUI Tools like Label,Button,Checkbox etc . load_workbook of openpyxl helps me to store data in a excel file .
Tkinter is Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library and OpenPyXL is a module that allows for reading and writing Excel files.

Steps to create the registration form:-
-->Create an Excel file: Make sure you have an empty Excel file (excel.xlsx) created and accessible. This file will store the registration data.
-->Create the Tkinter Window: We'll build a basic form with fields like Name, Course, Semester, Form Number, Contact Number, Email and Address.

<h1>USE CASE</h1>
We can use this concept in our organization's(school or college etc) website.In school or college when admission or enrollment like course occurrs then student can simply upload his data and we can easily save them . When these data are in our excel we can do data analysis using advance excel tool. 

<h1>Suggestions</h1>
We can do various improvements in my project . Like we can add a remember me function to save data both for user and organization . We can make design more beautiful and can add more data fields . Beyond a registration form if we modify this project like a digital data collecting form then we can costruct various dataset easily in a automated way which save our time and effort . And also when dataset is built then we can do various machine learning and data analysis outcomes.

The gist is that this is a dynamic and scalable project which can use for various problem solving , some of directly and some of indirectly.
